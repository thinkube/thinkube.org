title: Adding Nodes
description: Expand your cluster by adding worker nodes after initial installation
---

After the initial installation you can add worker nodes to your Thinkube cluster — including nodes of a different CPU architecture. The process uses the Thinkube Control UI for cluster operations and a terminal command for container image builds.

## Prerequisites

- A running Thinkube cluster
- Each new node meets the [prerequisites](./node-setup) (Ubuntu 24.04, SSH, internet access)
- No manual bootstrap script is needed — thinkube-control handles overlay setup for new nodes
- The overlay provider (ZeroTier or Tailscale) is configured automatically based on the cluster's `overlay_provider` setting

## Overview

Adding a node is a two-phase process:

| Phase | Where | What happens |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **1. Join** | Thinkube Control UI | Scan, detect hardware, join cluster, configure GPU/DNS |
| **2. Images** | Code-server terminal | Mirror and build container images, uncordon nodes |

Phase 1 runs in the browser and completes in a few minutes. Phase 2 runs in a terminal because image builds can take a long time (especially on first run) and benefit from direct retry if something fails.

## Phase 1: Join Nodes via the UI

### Step 1: Open Add Node Wizard

Navigate to **Thinkube Control → Nodes** and click **Add Nodes**. Enter the network CIDR to scan (e.g., `192.168.1.0/24`) and click **Scan**.

### Step 2: Select and Detect Hardware

The wizard discovers reachable nodes and shows their hostname, IP, and status. Select the nodes you want to add and click **Detect Hardware**. Thinkube will SSH into each node to identify:

- CPU architecture (ARM64 or AMD64)
- GPU model and count
- Disk configuration

### Step 3: Confirm and Join

Review the hardware summary and click **Add Nodes**. The UI streams progress as Thinkube:

1. Installs and configures the overlay provider (ZeroTier or Tailscale) on the new node
2. Distributes SSH keys for inter-node communication
3. Updates the Ansible inventory
4. Joins each node to the Kubernetes cluster
5. Cordons the new nodes (prevents scheduling)
6. Configures DNS resolution for internal domains
7. Deploys the GPU operator (if GPUs detected)
8. Configures GPU time-slicing profiles

When complete, the UI shows the nodes as **joined and cordoned** with a command to run in the terminal.

## Phase 2: Build Images from Terminal

Open a terminal in code-server and run the command shown in the UI:

```bash
tk_images rebuild --uncordon vilanova1,vilanova2
```

Replace `vilanova1,vilanova2` with your actual node hostnames.

This runs three playbooks in sequence:

1. **Mirror public images** — pulls images from Docker Hub, GCR, Quay.io and pushes them to your Harbor registry with per-architecture support
2. **Build base images** — builds platform images (Python, Node.js, CI tools, AI inference) natively on each architecture's node
3. **Build Jupyter image** — builds the JupyterLab image with GPU support

After all three succeed, it updates the build token and uncordons the nodes.

### Handling Failures

If a step fails, you see the error immediately in the terminal. Fix the issue and retry just the failed step:

```bash
tk_images mirror        # Retry only the public image mirroring
tk_images build-base    # Retry only the base image builds
tk_images build-jupyter # Retry only the Jupyter image build
```

Already-built images are skipped automatically — the playbooks check Harbor for existing per-architecture tags before building. A retry only rebuilds what's missing.

Once everything succeeds, uncordon the nodes manually if you didn't use `--uncordon`:

```bash
tk_images uncordon vilanova1,vilanova2
```

### Checking Status

To see the current state of your build and cluster:

```bash
tk_images status
```

This shows:
- **Build token** — which architectures have completed image builds
- **Cordoned nodes** — nodes that are joined but not yet accepting workloads
- **Cluster architectures** — all nodes and their CPU architecture

## What Happens During Image Builds

### First Node of a New Architecture

When you add an AMD64 node to an ARM64 cluster (or vice versa), every container image needs a second architecture variant. The build playbook:

1. Checks Harbor for each image's per-arch tag (e.g., `python-base:3.12-slim-amd64`)
2. Skips images that already exist for that architecture
3. Builds missing images **natively** on a node of the matching architecture — no QEMU emulation
4. Creates multi-arch manifest lists combining both architectures
5. Pushes the manifest to Harbor so `podman pull` or `containerd` automatically selects the right architecture

### Subsequent Nodes of the Same Architecture

If you add a second AMD64 node after the first one, no image rebuild is needed — the images already exist for both architectures. The UI detects this and uncordons the node immediately without requiring `tk_images`.

## Removing Nodes

To remove a worker node, use the Thinkube Control UI: navigate to **Nodes**, select the node, and click **Remove**. This drains workloads, removes the node from Kubernetes, and cleans up the inventory.

## Troubleshooting

### Node stuck in cordoned state

If `tk_images` failed and the node is still cordoned:

```bash
tk_images status          # Check what's cordoned
tk_images build-base      # Retry the failed step
tk_images uncordon node1  # Uncordon when ready
```

### DNS resolution fails on new node

The add-node flow configures DNS automatically. If a new node can't resolve `registry.cmxela.com` or other internal domains, the DNS step may have failed. Re-run the add-node wizard or configure DNS manually with:

```bash
tk_ansible ansible/40_thinkube/core/infrastructure/coredns/15_configure_node_dns.yaml --limit node1
```

### Image build fails with "exec format error"

This means a base image was only mirrored for one architecture. Run `tk_images mirror` to re-mirror all public images for both architectures, then retry the build.
