description: Prepare Ubuntu nodes for Thinkube installation
---

Before running the Thinkube installer, ensure each machine meets these prerequisites. The installer handles all overlay network setup, SSH configuration, and system preparation automatically — no manual bootstrap script is needed.

## Prerequisites

Each node must have:

- **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS** (Noble Numbat) installed
- **A non-root user** with sudo access
- **OpenSSH Server** installed and running
- **Internet connectivity**

### Expand Disk Storage

Ubuntu Server's installer creates a logical volume (LV) that uses only ~100 GB of the disk by default, regardless of actual disk size. Before proceeding, expand it to use all available space:

```bash
sudo lvextend -l +100%FREE /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu-vg/ubuntu-lv
```

Verify with `df -h /` — it should now show the full disk size.

## What the Installer Handles

During installation, the Thinkube installer automatically configures each node:

### Overlay Network
- Installs your chosen overlay provider (ZeroTier or Tailscale)
- Joins each node to your overlay network
- Assigns or discovers overlay IPs
- Verifies connectivity between all nodes

### System
- Installs required tools (Git, Python, Ansible)
- Configures SSH key-based authentication between nodes
- Sets up required kernel modules for Kubernetes

## Verification

After installation, you can verify overlay connectivity:

```bash
# For ZeroTier
sudo zerotier-cli status
sudo zerotier-cli listnetworks

# For Tailscale
tailscale status
```

## Next Steps

Once all machines meet the prerequisites:
1. Set up your [overlay network token](./overlay-network) (ZeroTier or Tailscale)
2. Run the [Thinkube Installer](./overview)
