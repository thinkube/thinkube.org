# /pair-next

The work-loop pulse. `/pair-next` drives a Spec's slices **to completion** and then runs the **acceptance sequence** — it does not stop between slices. Per TEP-0010 a Spec runs on **one branch, slices executing consecutively and autonomously**, with the **single human gate at acceptance**. So one `/pair-next` invocation: verifies and lands the in-flight slice, then keeps pulling the next Ready slice — verify → check AC → Done — until none remain, and only then stops for the human's one approval before merging the Spec's single PR.

It's **Ready → Doing → Done** per slice (one automated gate at Done: reviewer + verifier both run inside it — no Review/Verify handoff, no comment step), then **one spec-level acceptance gate** (automated re-verify **and** human accept) before the Spec is done.

## Mission

In one invocation, for the active Spec:

1. Run every Ready slice to Done — for each: verify (the `verifier` runs the repo's checks per `repo-conventions`), check the AC it satisfies, `move_slice` to `Done`. **No pause between slices** — no pick-bless, no "move the card" prompt. Stop only on a verifier red, a `move_slice` refusal, or a failed precondition.
2. Keep a stale-spec sweep honest as you go — resolve substantively-stale done slices before starting new work.
3. When no Ready slices remain, enter the **acceptance sequence**: **explain** the assembled implementation across the slices → wait for the human's single **approval** → on approval, `accept_spec` (the spec-level gate) → on pass, **merge the Spec's one PR**. Spec done.

## Procedure

### A. Run the slices to completion (loop — no inter-slice stops)

Repeat the following until there is **no slice in Doing and no eligible Ready slice** under the active Spec. Do **not** stop between iterations to ask the human anything — autonomous execution is the point (TEP-0010). The only stops are the three exceptions named in the constraints.

1. **Identify the in-flight slice.** `mcp__thinkube-kanban__list_board`; find the card in **Doing** under the active Spec. Keep **one slice in flight per Spec** — if there are somehow multiple (board drift), reconcile them this run (verify covers the whole branch; check each one's AC and land each) and note the drift; only ask the human if it's genuinely ambiguous which work a card represents. **If none is in Doing,** go straight to the pick (step 6) for the first iteration.
2. **Verify.** Delegate to the `verifier` subagent (via `Task` tool):
   - The verifier reads `repo-conventions` for the project's verification recipe and runs it.
   - Verifier returns `{ ok: true }` or `{ ok: false, reason, evidence }`.
   - On red: **stop the loop** — a verifier red is a gate refusal, a legitimate stop point. Surface the failures **verbatim** and do not move the card. The human fixes the failing code (substance); say you'll re-verify and resume the loop once it's addressed. Don't instruct the user to re-run a command to advance the mechanics.
3. **Check the satisfied AC on the Spec — before the move.** Determine which AC ordinal(s) this slice delivers: prefer the slice's `satisfies: [<ac-ordinal>, …]` frontmatter (the 1-based AC positions it delivers); for a legacy slice without that field, fall back to the AC its body names. Mark each corresponding `- [ ]` checked (`- [x]`) in `specs/SP-{n}/spec.md` via `Edit`. (A checkbox toggle is a metadata change — it does not mark other slices stale.) Do this **first**: the → Done gate refuses the move while a satisfied AC is unchecked, naming the criterion. (A slice with no `satisfies` field passes that gate ungated, but still check the AC its scope covers.)
4. **Move the finished slice to Done.** On green and with the AC checked: `mcp__thinkube-kanban__move_slice { slice: "SP-{n}_SL-{m}", status: "Done" }`. This sets `status: done` and **stamps `verified_req_hash`** with the Spec's current requirement-hash automatically — you don't write that field by hand. Report the move inline with evidence (the verify result + the AC checked); keep going — don't hand the move or the checkbox to the user.
5. **Stale-spec sweep.** Check whether any **done** sibling under the active Spec went stale. From `list_board`, each card carries `specStale` (bool) and `specChange` (`none` | `metadata` | `requirements`):
   - **`specChange: "requirements"`** (substantive — the Spec's `## Acceptance Criteria` text / `## Design` / `## Constraints` changed since this slice was verified): **resolve before new work.** Re-run the `verifier` against the current Spec; if the slice no longer meets the new AC, move it back to `Doing` and re-open the affected `specs/SP-{n}/spec.md` checkbox. Tell the user what changed.
   - **`specChange: "metadata"`** (status move, priority/theme/due edit, or an AC checkbox toggle): not a real change — no re-verification.
6. **Pick the next slice.** Top of Ready under the same Spec with its `depends_on` satisfied. `move_slice { slice, status: "Doing" }`, then `get_slice` for its body and the parent Spec section it implements. **Implement it, commit on `spec/SP-{n}`, and loop back to step 2** — without pausing for confirmation. When no eligible Ready slice remains, leave the loop and go to **B**.

### B. Acceptance sequence (the single human gate)

Reached when every slice under the Spec is Done. This is the **one** place `/pair-next` stops for the human (TEP-0010).

7. **Explain the assembled implementation.** Summarise what the slices, together, built — mapped to the Spec's acceptance criteria, ideally with a real end-to-end demonstration (not a box re-tick). This is the "human can judge the whole" step that per-slice greens can't provide.
8. **Wait for the human's approval — bless point.** Stop here for the single marked decision: the human **accepts** (proceed) or **sends it back** (name what's wrong → it becomes new slices / fixes, and the loop resumes). Do not run acceptance before this approval.
9. **Run the acceptance gate.** On approval: `mcp__thinkube-kanban__accept_spec { spec: "SP-{n}" }`. The server **refuses** unless every slice is Done and every AC is checked (it names the blocker) — the automated half of the gate, mirroring `move_slice`'s AC refusal. On refusal, surface it verbatim and resolve (usually a missed AC checkbox or an un-landed slice), then retry.
10. **Merge the Spec's one PR.** On a green accept, the acceptance card moves to Done and the Spec's single PR merges (`gh pr merge spec/SP-{n}` — the board's **Accept Spec** button does this for you; from the loop, run it after `accept_spec`). One branch, one PR, merged once. The Spec is done.
11. **Brief the user** — the slices landed, the acceptance result, the merge.

## Constraints

- **Don't stop between slices.** Within a Spec, run Ready→Done to completion. No pick-bless, no per-slice "confirm the move." The only stops are: a **verifier red**, a **`move_slice`/`accept_spec` refusal**, or a **failed precondition** — plus the **one acceptance approval** in step 8.
- **Verifier red is non-negotiable.** Never move a slice to Done while checks fail. Surface, let the human fix, re-verify, resume.
- **One slice in flight per Spec** while looping — don't fan out parallel Doing cards.
- **Don't fake a gate.** If `move_slice` or `accept_spec` refuses, surface the reason verbatim and resolve it — don't work around it.
- **Don't stamp `verified_req_hash` by hand.** `move_slice → Done` records it; the sweep compares against it.
- **Acceptance is human + automated.** `accept_spec` is the automated half; it runs **only after** the human approves (step 8). Re-ticking AC boxes is not acceptance — the human judging the assembled result is.

## Output

```
🔬 SP-{n}_SL-3   tsc ✅  webview ✅  tests ✅ 18 passed
☑ AC #2 checked   🟢 SP-{n}_SL-3 → Done (req_hash stamped)

🔬 SP-{n}_SL-4   tsc ✅  webview ✅  tests ✅ 19 passed
☑ AC #3 checked   🟢 SP-{n}_SL-4 → Done (req_hash stamped)

(no Ready slices remain — entering acceptance)

📦 Assembled SP-{n}: <one-paragraph walkthrough of what the slices built,
   mapped to AC #1–#4, with how to see it working end-to-end>

⏸ Acceptance — your call: accept SP-{n}, or send it back with what's wrong.
```

After the human accepts:

```
✅ accept_spec SP-{n} — gate green (all slices Done, all AC checked, accept recorded)
🔀 Merged PR spec/SP-{n} → main. SP-{n} done.
```

## Safety / fallback

- **Verifier subagent missing.** If `.claude/agents/verifier.md` isn't installed, run the `repo-conventions` verification recipe directly via `Bash`. Suggest re-installing the bundle.
- **Verification recipe not detected.** Tell the user. Don't guess — ask for the right command and add it to `repo-conventions`.
- **`move_slice` / `accept_spec` gate refuses.** Surface the reason verbatim. If → Done is rejecting because the satisfied AC isn't checked, check it (step 3) and retry. If `accept_spec` refuses, resolve the named blocker and retry.
- **PR merge fails** (no PR yet for the branch, `gh` missing/unauthenticated, merge rejected): surface the error; the accept stamp is written only after a successful merge, so the Spec is not left "accepted" with its PR open — fix the cause and retry the merge.
- **Navigator mode.** The MCP server refuses board writes from Claude. Verification still runs and the AC edits + moves are proposed; tell the user to make the moves and the accept themselves.
